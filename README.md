My name is Aneesh Prasad. 
Welcome to my world.

Election Predictor – used R to model the 2014 election based on 2004 election results and 2010 socio-economic and race data with k-nearest-neighbors and recursive partitioning techniques

Network Game AI – used Java to design program that intelligently plays the game Network and uses game tree search techniques such as alpha-beta pruning and recursive implementation of the minimax algorithm

Parallel Image Convolution – used C, Open MP, and SSE Intrinsics to run image convolution at 50 Gflops/s leveraging parallel processing techniques

Sliding Tile Puzzle Solver – used Python and Amazon EC2 servers to strongly solve the sliding tile puzzle game using a Breadth-First Search algorithm written in the Spark framework.
